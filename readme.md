# Building a high efficiency trading bot focused on memecoins in solana blockchain (for now)

### Basic Goals
- Connect to the Solana blockchain using public RPC endpoints
- Monitor for newly listed tokens/pairs on a chosen DEX
- Trigger buy orders as soon as criteria are met
- Potentially monitor position and sell under certain profit conditions


#### How to later run the actual bot? 
1. Create and activate a venv
2. Run 'pip install -r requirements.txt'
3. Place your Solanca keypare JSON file in 'local_keys/' 

#### Running
